# Re-Engineering Legacy Software - Code Samples

This repository contains the code used for all the listings in the book, as well as any other code I used to generate those listings.

Some of the listings contain (hopefully) useful code, while others are examples of code that is untestable or otherwise "bad".

There is a directory per chapter, and some chapters have their directories further sub-divided by topic. Each chapter's directory contains a README file with more details.

Where a directory corresponds directly to a numbered code listing in the book, it will have the listing number in the directory name, e.g. `1.1_ImageResizer` contains the code for Listing 1.1.
